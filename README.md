A set of classes to use [Spatie's crawler](https://github.com/spatie/crawler) with Laravel. Aim is to simplify building crawler applications or adding a crawler to an existing Laravel project. At the moment the following helper classes are implemented:

## Cache Crawl Queue

The [CacheCrawlQueue](https://github.com/spekulatius/spatie-crawler-toolkit-for-laravel/blob/master/src/Queues/CacheCrawlQueue.php) allows use the pre-configured Cache in Laravel to store the queue. It stores any actions performed on the queue directly to avoid the need to manually store the queue. You can add it directly to your crawler:

```php
Crawler::create()
    ->setCrawlQueue(new \Spekulatius\SpatieCrawlerToolkit\Queues\CacheCrawlQueue($url))
    ->startCrawling($url);
```

With this you can stop the crawl and restart at any time. This requires a cache-driver being configured in your `.env` file.

## Crawl Logger

The [Crawl Logger](https://github.com/spekulatius/spatie-crawler-toolkit-for-laravel/blob/master/src/Observers/CrawlLogger.php) is an observer you can add to your crawler to enable logging of crawl events:

```php
Crawler::create()
    ->setCrawlObserver(new \Spekulatius\SpatieCrawlerToolkit\Observers\CrawlLogger)
    ->startCrawling($url);
```

You can export the configuration (see below) to tweak which events are logged.

## Crawl Events

The toolkit contains an observer to send you Laravel events allowing you to react to crawl events. This covers the following events:

- [WillCrawl](https://github.com/spekulatius/spatie-crawler-toolkit-for-laravel/blob/master/src/Events/WillCrawl.php)
- [Crawled](https://github.com/spekulatius/spatie-crawler-toolkit-for-laravel/blob/master/src/Events/Crawled.php)
- [CrawlFailed](https://github.com/spekulatius/spatie-crawler-toolkit-for-laravel/blob/master/src/Events/CrawlFailed.php)
- [FinishedCrawling](https://github.com/spekulatius/spatie-crawler-toolkit-for-laravel/blob/master/src/Events/FinishedCrawling.php)

By default, no events are emitted. To enable events, you will need to add the event observer to your crawler:

```
Crawler::create()
    ->setCrawlObserver(new \Spekulatius\SpatieCrawlerToolkit\Observers\CrawlEvents)
    ->startCrawling($url);
```

## Planned functionality
